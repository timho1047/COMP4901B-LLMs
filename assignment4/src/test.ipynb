Let us do casework on how many blues there are. \\nIf there are no blues whatsoever, there is only one case. This case is valid, as all of the (zero) blues have gone to reds. (One could also view it as: the location of all the blues now were not previously red.) Thus, we have $1$. \\nIf there is a single blue somewhere, there are $8$ cases - where can the blue be? Each of these is valid. \\nIf there are two blues, again, every case is valid, and there are $\\\\dbinom82=28$ cases. \\nIf there are three blues, every case is again valid; there are $\\\\dbinom83=56$ such cases. \\nThe case with four blues is trickier. Let us look at all possible subcases. \\nIf all four are adjacent (as in the diagram below), it is obvious: we can simply reverse the diagram (rotate it by $4$ units) to achieve the problem's condition.

By the Pigeonhole Principle, $r\\\\geq{b} \\\\Longrightarrow b\\\\leq4$ if a configuration is valid.\\nWe claim that if $b\\\\leq3$, then any configuration is valid. We attempt to prove by the following:\\nIf there are \\\\[b\\\\in{0,1,2}\\\\] vertices, then intuitively any configuration is valid. For $b=3$, we do cases:\\nIf all the vertices in $b$ are non-adjacent, then simply rotating once in any direction suffices. If there are $2$ adjacent vertices, then WLOG let us create a set $\\\\{b_1,b_2,r_1\\\\cdots\\\\}$ where the third $b_3$ is somewhere later in the set. If we assign the set as $\\\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\\\}$ and $b_3\\\\leq4$, then intuitively, rotating it $4$ will suffice. If $b_3=5$, then rotating it by 2 will suffice. Consider any other $b_3>5$ as simply a mirror to a configuration of the cases.\\nTherefore, if $b\\\\leq3$, then there are $\\\\sum_{i=0}^{3}{\\\\binom{8}{i}}=93$ ways. We do count the [i]degenerate[/i] case.\\nNow if $b=4$, we do casework on the number of adjacent vertices.\\n0 adjacent: $\\\\{b_1,r_1,b_2,r_2\\\\cdots{r_4}\\\\}$. There are 4 axes of symmetry so there are only $\\\\frac{8}{4}=2$ rotations of this configuration.\\n1 adjacent: WLOG $\\\\{b_1,b_2\\\\cdots{b_3}\\\\cdots{b_4}\\\\}$ where $b_4\\\\neq{8}$. Listing out the cases and trying, we get that $b_3=4$ and $b_4=7$ is the only configuration. There are $8$ ways to choose $b_1$ and $b_2$ and the rest is set, so there are $8$ ways.\\n2 adjacent: We can have WLOG $\\\\{b_1,b_2\\\\cdots{b_3},b_4\\\\}$ or $\\\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\\\cdots\\\\}$ where $b_4\\\\neq{8}$. The former yields the case $b_3=5$ and $b_4=6$ by simply rotating it 2 times. The latter yields none. There are 2 axes of symmetry so there are $\\\\frac{8}{2}=4$ configurations.\\n3 adjacent: WLOG $\\\\{b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4\\\\cdots\\\\}$ which intuitively works. There are $8$ configurations here as $b_1$ can is unique.\\nIn total, $b=4$ yields $2+8+4+8=22$ configurations.\\nThere are $22+93=115$ configurations in total. There are $2^8=256$ total cases, so the probability is $\\\\frac{115}{256}$. Adding them up, we get $115+256=\\\\boxed{371}$.\",\n",
